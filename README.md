# "Chess Game" -- definitely not final name

This project is intended to be a basis from which I can create chess variant game(s). As the first (and current) step, I will be implementing normal chess.

Uses the modules by [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).

Chess pieces and board created by Rad Potato on itch.io, found [here](https://rad-potato.itch.io/pixel-perfect-ultimate-game-component-kit).
